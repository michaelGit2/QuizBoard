##### Description
This quiz board system simulates a real paper work exam done in classes by students. 
The funny part of it is that their exists no physical examinner to mark your work and bring back results later.
Woried?? dont be! The examiner is inside the system and you will get your results as soon as you finish the test.
Since it is an exam, you need to be ranked/graded, so, you can only take the test ONCE!
